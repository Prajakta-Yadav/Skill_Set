# Skill_Set
This repository serves as a dynamic portfolio and a personal log of my journey in software development. It's a place where I organize, document, and showcase my technical skills through practical coding examples and personal projects. The goal is to track my progress, experiment with new concepts, and build a comprehensive resource of my abilities.
The content is organized by programming language and technology to keep everything clear and accessible. You'll find a dedicated folder for each skill, containing coding exercises, small projects, and experiments.

html/: Contains my work with HyperText Markup Language, including semantic structures and webpage layouts.

css/: Houses my styling and design projects, from basic selectors to more advanced concepts like animations. I've recently added an animation experiment using HTML and CSS to showcase a moving div element.

javascript/: A collection of scripts, functions, and small applications to demonstrate my understanding of JavaScript.

python/: My projects and practice files related to Python programming.

java/: Code snippets and programs written in Java.
